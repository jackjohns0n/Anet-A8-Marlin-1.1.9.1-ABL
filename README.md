# Anet A8 Marlin 1.1.9.1 ABL
 Marlin 1.1.9.1 firmware configured for Anet A8 3d printer with capacitive bed leveling sensor such as Uptanium
 
 This is my own modified configuration file.  I have an Uptanium branded (https://uptanium.org/Auto-Bed-levelling-on-Glass.html) 
 capacitive bed leveling sensor.  The sensor came with Marlin 1.1.8 firmware so I took the uptanium config file and transfered 
 the relevant settings to 1.1.9 marlin Anet A8 config file.  I also increased the bilinear bed leveling grid from 6x6 to 12x12.
